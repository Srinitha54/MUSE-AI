#Title : MUSE_AI: Transforming words into Melodies

**Mini_Proj_MUSE_AI** is an AI-based music generation system that transforms a text prompt into a full **melodic song** — including poetic lyrics, a piano-style background melody, and a realistic singing voice using TTS.



## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Text-to-lyrics generation using GPT-2
- 🎼 Piano-style background music generation using NumPy
- 🗣️ Singing voice generation using gTTS
- 🎧 Combines voice + melody into a final song
- 📊 Visualizes waveform like heartbeat lines (Matplotlib)

📝 Future Improvements
🎤 Refining the Voice Quality
Improve the naturalness and clarity of the generated voice output.

🎙️ Voice as Input Option
Allow users to input their own voice to be combined with generated music.

🎸 Add Instrument Layers
Incorporate more instruments like Guitar, Violin, or Drums in the background.

🧠 Emotion-Aware Music Generation
Use emotion detection from lyrics to control melody mood (e.g., sad, happy, inspiring).
